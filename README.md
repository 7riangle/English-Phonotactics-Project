# English Phonotactics Project(Received Pronunciation)

## Overview  
This personal project explores **English phonotactics** by generating random phoneme sequences based on phonotactic constraints.  
It uses **Python** to randomly construct valid English syllables while considering onset, nucleus, and coda constraints.  

## Features  
- Generates **random phonological sequences** following English phonotactic rules  
- Ensures **phoneme constraints** (e.g., /≈ã/ cannot appear in the onset position)  
- Utilizes **Python's `random` module** to simulate phonotactic patterns  

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage  
1. Clone the repository or download the Python file:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/7riangle/English-Phonotactics-Project.git
   cd English-Phonotactics-Project
